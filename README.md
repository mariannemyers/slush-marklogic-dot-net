# Slush Slush-marklogic-dotnet [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mariannemyers/slush-slush-marklogic-dotnet.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mariannemyers/slush-slush-marklogic-dotnet) [![NPM version](https://badge-me.herokuapp.com/api/npm/slush-slush-marklogic-dotnet.png)](http://badges.enytc.com/for/npm/slush-slush-marklogic-dotnet)

>  Angular/ASP.NET Core/MarkLogic application


## Getting Started

Install `slush-slush-marklogic-dotnet` globally:

```bash
$ cd path-to/slush-marklogic-dotnet
$ sudo npm link
```

### Usage

Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
$ mkdir my-slush-slush-marklogic-dotnet
```

Run the generator from within the new folder:

```bash
$ cd my-slush-slush-marklogic-dotnet && slush slush-marklogic-dotnet
```
Answer the questions when prompted.

```bash
$ cd app
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet run
```
Visit http://localhost:5000

... but the app in the present state is missing files required to run the app.  Marianne thought she fixed, but apparently she didn't.

## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.

To find out more about Slush, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/slushjs/slush).
